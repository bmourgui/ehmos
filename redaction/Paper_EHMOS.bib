	abstract = {Entomological studies often aim to estimate species distribution, community composition, or species-richness patterns. False absences can, however, bias these estimates and should consequently not be overlooked in insect studies. Multi-species occupancy models (MSOMs) afford a flexible solution to cover the main topics in ecological entomology while dealing with detectability issues. We sampled Orthoptera communities at 81 mountain grasslands sites in France, using three sampling techniques: sighting, listening, and sweep netting. Five plots were sampled per site. This sampling design allowed MSOMs to be used to estimate richness, occupancy, and detection probabilities while accounting for the effect of covariates. We also used MSOMs to evaluate the efficiency of the survey design and to assess the effects of sampling optimisation. The estimates obtained for altitudinal distribution were reliable, with known species distributions confirming the relevance of MSOMs to model the effects of covariates on Orthoptera communities. The species-specific detection probability was often less than one and varied with the detection technique used and the grass height, confirming the need to deal with detection issues in orthopteran studies. We estimated an inventory completeness superior to 0.80 for 93\% of the sites, and an overall detection probability superior to 0.95 for 52\% of the species, suggesting the sampling design was suitable for studying occupancy in Orthoptera communities. We also found that the sweep netting step may be omitted or the number of plots reduced without affecting species detectability or inventory completeness. Those recommendations may help to optimise future sampling strategies.},

	abstract = {Temporal variation in natural selection is predicted to strongly impact the evolution and demography of natural populations, with consequences for the rate of adaptation, evolution of plasticity, and extinction risk. Most of the theory underlying these predictions assumes a moving optimum phenotype, with predictions expressed in terms of the temporal variance and autocorrelation of this optimum. However, empirical studies seldom estimate patterns of fluctuations of an optimum phenotype, precluding further progress in connecting theory with observations. To bridge this gap, we assess the evidence for temporal variation in selection on breeding date by modeling a fitness function with a fluctuating optimum, across 39 populations of 21 wild animals, one of the largest compilations of long-term datasets with individual measurements of trait and fitness components. We find compelling evidence for fluctuations in the fitness function, causing temporal variation in the magnitude, but not the direction of selection. However, fluctuations of the optimum phenotype need not directly translate into variation in selection gradients, because their impact can be buffered by partial tracking of the optimum by the mean phenotype. Analyzing individuals that reproduce in consecutive years, we find that plastic changes track movements of the optimum phenotype across years, especially in bird species, reducing temporal variation in directional selection. This suggests that phenological plasticity has evolved to cope with fluctuations in the optimum, despite their currently modest contribution to variation in selection.},

Many ecological and evolutionary processes strongly depend on the way natural selection varies over time. However, a gap remains when trying to connect theoretical predictions to empirical work on this question: Most theory assumes that adaptation involves tracking a moving optimum phenotype through time, but this is seldom estimated empirically. Here, we have assembled a large database of wild bird and mammal populations, to estimate patterns of fluctuations in the optimum breeding date and its influence on the variability of natural selection. We find that optimum fluctuations are prevalent. However, their influence on temporal variance in natural selection is partly buffered by tracking of the optimum phenotype through individual phenotypic plasticity.

	abstract = {Niche changes during a species’ lifespan are known as ontogenetic niche shifts. These shifts reflect changes in resource availability, requirements, organisms’ foraging ability and/or size-dependent biotic interactions. In the plant kingdom, however, this issue remains poorly covered. We investigated nutritional niche shifts over the ontogeny of 23 temperate tree species (among nine phylogenetic families) by a synchronic approach. We used 1963 temporary phytoecological surveys conducted throughout metropolitan French forests. The realised niches of three life-history stages (seedling: {\textless}0.5 m; sapling: {\textgreater}0.5 m and {\textless} 8 m; tree: {\textgreater}8 m) in each tree species were modelled on the basis of presence/absence data and the main factors of species distribution (energy, water and nutritional resources). We computed the nutritional optima and amplitudes by bootstrapping partial response curves for the C:N ratio and base saturation rate. We assessed changes in these niche parameters over ontogeny and also evaluated the relative importance of ontogenetic shifts in the differentiation of nutritional niche among the selected tree species. The tree stage was found to occur mainly at higher nutrient availability than the seedling (+16.3\% on the nutritional gradient) or sapling (+11.1\%) stages. In addition, nutritional niches of tree species exhibited, successively, a niche enlargement in eutrophic conditions and a niche restriction in oligotrophic conditions during growth. These global nutritional niche shifts observed over the species’ lifespan contributed moderately but significantly to the niche separation in temperate tree communities (up to 4.5\%). We interpreted niche shifts as a response to an increase in nutritional requirements over ontogeny, leading to an intra-specific selection where individuals established in eutrophic soils have the maximal fitness. Biotic interactions and temporal changes in the environment may secondarily enhance or counteract the process. The importance of ontogenetic niche shifts requires consideration in the study of species autecology and plant community organisation.},

	abstract = {Many animals and plant species have advanced spring phenology in response to climate warming. The majority of avian phenological studies are based on arrival dates. Consequently, knowledge on bird phenology is mainly based on migratory species. In addition, arrival dates of migratory birds may be substantially affected by en route climate conditions, thus failing to provide good indicators for spring phenology on the breeding grounds. Correlating arrival dates with other phenological data or with environmental covariates may be meaningless in these cases. We propose the date of highest singing activity, quantified by detection probability, as a powerful proxy for breeding phenology that is applicable to migratory and sedentary bird species alike. In contrast to arrival dates, breeding phenology is mainly (non-migrants) or at least partially (migrants) influenced by conditions experienced within the breeding area. We developed a new method for flexible estimation of peak detectability date in spring by combining multiseason site occupancy with semi-parametric regression modelling (thin-plate splines). We applied our approach to opportunistic observations of 27 bird species (mostly passerines) in Switzerland. We found substantial differences among species in the date of spring peak detectability: late February to mid-April in sedentary and short-distance migratory species and mid-April to late May in long-distance migrants. Among 10 species with data for {\textgreater}9 years, five showed a trend in detectability peaks towards an earlier spring phenology by nine to 17 days within 10 years. The mean shift over all species was c. 3·5 days per 10 years. Our approach is widely applicable, especially for temporally and spatially large-scale data from monitoring or citizen-science programmes. Besides using the detectability peak as measure of phenology, the estimated seasonal pattern in detectability can help designing monitoring programmes for improved efficiency. Our approach may be applied to any species with pronounced acoustic displays or other behavioural traits strongly influencing detectability during the breeding period. We believe that it can contribute substantially to unravelling how species and communities respond to environmental change.},

	abstract = {1. Studies reporting phenological changes in response to climate change are numerous and concern all groups of living organisms. Phenological changes could cause mismatching in food chains, thus inducing important perturbations in ecosystem functioning. Nevertheless, the relevancy of the conclusions drawn from phenological studies strongly depends on the estimation accuracy of such phenological changes. Many different estimators exist and some have already raised major criticism, although they continue to be used. Therefore, there is a crucial need for an extensive study documenting the behaviour of phenological estimators. 2. Here, we compare the estimation efficiency of 10 phenological estimators: different first appearance dates, mean dates, different percentile dates and a smoothing method based on spline functions using simulated phenological data. Root mean-squared errors and bias of the phenological estimations are calculated in relation to different parameters of the simulated phenological data. 3. Results show that first appearance dates behave as a very inaccurate and biased estimator regarding any phenological data set. Mean dates and estimates calculated using the smoothing method provided in general the most accurate estimates of phenological shifts. They were also the most robust to variation in sample sizes and to imperfect detectability. 4. Our results allow us to warn against the use of first appearance dates in future phenological studies and to recommend using mean dates or smoothing techniques to estimate phenological change of entire distributions. We also provide advice concerning phenological monitoring effort. These recommendations should most importantly apply to studies aiming at comparing phenological variation among sites or among species.},

A simple weighted averaging (WA) method for estimating these parameters is compared by simulation with the more elaborate method of Gaussian logistic regression (GLR), a form of the generalized linear model which fits a Gaussian-like species response curve to presence-absence data. The indicator value and the ecological amplitude are expressed by two parameters of this curve, termed the optimum and the tolerance, respectively. When a species is rare and has a narrow ecological amplitude — or when the distribution of quadrats along the environmental variable is reasonably even over the species' range, and the number of quadrats is small — then WA is shown to approach GLR in efficiency. Otherwise WA may give misleading results. GLR is therefore preferred as a practical method for summarizing species' distributions along environmental gradients. Formulas are given to calculate species optima and tolerances (with their standard errors), and a confidence interval for the optimum from the GLR output of standard statistical packages.},

We considered the variability in ENMs performance to estimate a weighted mean difference between potential geographic distributions for baseline and future climates. On average, potential future ranges were projected to be from 25.7\% to 44.5\% smaller than current potential ranges across species. However, we found that 0.2\% to 18.3\% of the total variance in range shifts occurred “within species” (i.e., owing to the use of different modeling techniques and climate models) and 81.7\% to 99.8\% remained between species (i.e., it could be explained by ecological correlates). Using meta-analytical techniques akin to regression, we also showed that potential range shifts are barely predicted by bird biological traits. We demonstrated that one can combine and reduce species-specific effects with high uncertainty in ENMs and also explore potential causes of climate change effect on species using meta-analytical tools. We also highlight that the search for powerful correlates of climate change-induced range shifts can be a promising line of investigation.},

	abstract = {1. Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models’ assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species. 2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation. 3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario. 4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MaxEnt. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings. 5. Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made accessible in MaxEnt provide a forward step.},

	abstract = {Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many taxa, including bees, plants, birds, butterflies and fishes. A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs. To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977–2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast. In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator). We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.},

	abstract = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation.},

Methods We analysed presence–absence data using two successive surveys of the Spanish Forest Inventory in five Fagaceae tree species (two temperate: Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea, one sub-Mediterranean: Q. faginea and two Mediterranean: Q. suber and Q. ilex) in two mountain ranges (the Pyrenees and the Iberian system). Half of the fitted altitudinal distributions were skewed and required use of an asymmetric model for unbiased estimates of optimum altitude and changes in the probability of presence along the altitudinal gradient. For each species and mountain range, shifts were considered to have occurred when the difference in optimum altitude was significant or when differences in probability of occurrence between the two surveys demonstrated the occurrence of colonization or extirpation events. Results Overall, depending on species and mountain range, shifts in optimum altitude ranged between −34 m and +181 m. The altitudinal distribution of the Mediterranean species at the core of their latitudinal distribution range presented no sign of change. For the temperate and sub-Mediterranean Fagaceae species, the patterns demonstrated the existence of distribution changes over a 10-yr period. The largest, although not statistically significant, upward shift in optimum altitude was observed for Q. petraea in the Iberian system. More interestingly, its distribution indicated colonization events at higher altitudes. For Q. faginea in the Pyrenees, the shift in optimum altitude was the second largest and statistically significant, and was associated with large extirpation events at the lower altitudes. No evidence of shifts was observed for F. sylvatica. Conclusion This work demonstrates that changes in altitudinal distribution could occur over a 10-yr time period for tree species located at the southern limit of their distribution, such as some temperate and sub-Mediterranean oaks, whereas no movement was detected for Mediterranean oaks in the core of their distribution area.},

Here, we investigate changes in the elevational distribution of dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in two separate mountain regions in Europe. Location South-western Alps (France) and Sierra Nevada (Spain). Methods We compared historical and current data on dung beetle distributions along elevation gradients for 30 species in the SW Alps and 19 species in the Sierra Nevada. We tested for significant changes between survey periods in three parameters: mean elevation and upper and lower range limits. Results We found up-slope range shifts for 63\% and 90\% of the species in the SW Alps and Sierra Nevada, respectively. Up-slope range shifts resulted mainly from expansion of upper range limits in the SW Alps and from changes of both range limits in the Sierra Nevada. The magnitudes of range shifts were consistent with the level of warming experienced in each region, but they also reflected the asymmetrical warming observed along the elevation gradients. Smaller changes were observed for species reaching their historical range limits at the higher elevations, associated with a non-significant increase in temperature between periods. Main conclusions The differences observed between regions are related to the geographical position of each mountain range, which determines the characteristics (including thermal tolerance) of the regional species pool, and the level of warming, which determines whether maximum thermal tolerance has been exceeded for the majority of species in the region. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the biogeography of the mountain and the species pool under study when assessing the sensitivity of species to future climate change in mountain regions.},

The response curve of a species in the fundamental niche is usually assumed to be quadratic. The centre of a quadratic curve represents a species' optimal environmental conditions, and the width its ability to tolerate deviations from the optimum. Most multivariate methods assume species respond linearly to niche axes, or with a quadratic curve that is of equal width for all species. However, it is widely understood that some species have the ability to better tolerate deviations from their optimal environment (generalists) compared to other (specialist) species. Rare species often tolerate a smaller range of environments than more common species, corresponding to a narrow niche. We propose a new method, for ordination and fitting Joint Species Distribution Models, based on Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Models, which relaxes the assumptions of equal tolerances.

With their variable microclimate, role as corridors for species movement and reoccurring disturbance events, they show several characteristics that might influence range dynamics of both native and non-native species. Previous research on plant species ranges in mountains however seldom included the effects of roads. To study how ranges of native and non-native species differ between roads and adjacent vegetation, we used a global dataset of plant species composition along mountain roads. We compared average elevation and range width of species, and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to compile their range optimum and amplitude. We then explored differences between roadside and adjacent plots based on a species’ origin (native vs non-native) and nitrogen and temperature affinity. Most non-native species had on average higher elevational ranges and broader amplitudes in roadsides. Higher optima for non-native species were associated with high nitrogen and temperature affinity. While lowland native species showed patterns comparable to those in non-native species, highland native species had significantly lower elevational ranges in roadsides compared to the adjacent vegetation. We conclude that roadsides indeed change the elevational ranges of a variety of species. These changes are not limited to the expansion of non-native species along mountain roads, but also include both upward and downward changes in ranges of native species. Roadsides may thus facilitate upward range shifts, for instance related to climate change, and they could serve as corridors to facilitate migration of alpine species between adjacent high-elevation areas. We recommend including the effects of mountain roads in species distribution models to fine-tune the predictions of range changes in a warming climate.},

Methods We used abundance monitoring data to quantify changes in bird species distributions between two time periods, 2000–02 and 2010–12. First we examined shifts at the level of whole distributions using population centroids in temperature, rainfall, altitude, latitude and longitude. We then characterized shifts in temperature and latitude at different parts of species ranges using species response curves (SRC). We accounted for yearly turnover in abundance and sampling effort, and compared the observed shifts with those expected under perfect niche tracking. Results Most species demonstrated changes in their distributions over the last decade but not all were in response to weather. The degree to which species tracked their climatic niches and the dynamics driving these shifts varied considerably. Only 20\% of species shifted in the direction expected given the temperature changes, while few showed a strong response to rainfall. Most shifts did not fully compensate for changes in temperature. Range changes were most evident at the leading edges, but there was some evidence for retractions of trailing edges. Amongst species that tracked temperature, those with southerly distributions were less successful at tracking changes than those in the north. Main conclusions Swedish birds demonstrated highly dynamic distributions, with many rapid directional shifts occurring over the last decade. However, only a few species kept pace with observed climatic change. Species that did not track their climatic niche may be tolerant to ongoing climatic change or constrained by strong habitat requirements. We demonstrate that measuring range shifts along both environmental and geographic gradients can help disentangle drivers of distribution changes.},

	abstract = {Climate change is affecting biodiversity worldwide inducing species to either “move, adapt or die”. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for analysing range shifts, namely a catalogue of the possible patterns of change in the distribution of a species along elevational or other environmental gradients and an improved quantitative methodology to identify and objectively describe these patterns. Patterns are defined in terms of changes occurring at the leading, trailing or both edges of the distribution: (a) leading edge expansion, (b) trailing edge retraction, (c) range expansion, (d) optimum shift, (e) expansion, (f) retraction, and (g) shift. The methodology is based on the modelling of species distributions along a gradient using generalized additive models (GAMs). Separate models are calibrated for two distinct periods of assessment and response curves are compared over five reference points. Changes occurred at these points are formalized into a code that ultimately designates the corresponding change pattern. We tested the proposed methodology using data from the Swiss national common breeding bird survey. The elevational distributions of 95 bird species were modelled for the periods 1999–2002 and 2004–2007 and significant upward shifts (all patterns confounded) were identified for 35\% of the species. Over the same period, an increase in mean temperature was registered for Switzerland. In consideration of the short period covered by the case study, assessed change patterns are considered to correspond to intermediate patterns in an ongoing shifting process. However, similar patterns can be determined by habitat barriers, land use/land cover changes, competition with concurrent or invasive species or different warming rates at different elevations.},

For this, we propose the trait-modulated Gaussian logistic model in which the niche parameters (optimum, tolerance and maximum) are made linearly dependent on species traits. The model is fitted to data in the Bayesian framework using OpenBUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) to identify according to which environmental variables there is niche differentiation among species and traits. We illustrate the method with phytoplankton community data of 203 lakes located within four climate zones and associated measurements on 11 environmental variables and six morphological species traits of 60 species. Temperature and chlorophyll-a (with opposite signs) described well the niche structure of all species. Results showed that about 25\% of the variance in the niche centres with respect to chlorophyll-a were accounted for by traits, whereas niche width and maximum could not be predicted by traits. Volume, mucilage, flagella and siliceous exoskeleton are found to be the most important traits to explain the niche centres. Species were clustered in two groups with different niches structures, group 1 high temperature-low chlorophyll-a species and group 2 low temperature-high chlorophyll-a species. Compared to group 2, species in group 1 had larger volume but lower surface area, had more often flagella but neither mucilage nor siliceous exoskeleton. These results might help in understanding the effect of environmental changes on phytoplankton community. The proposed method, therefore, can also apply to other aquatic or terrestrial communities for which individual traits and environmental conditioning factors are available.},

Location The two regions investigated are oceanic north-western France (NW) and semicontinental north-eastern France (NE). Methods For each of the 46 species with more than 50 occurrences in both NW and NE regions, an ecological response curve was computed with simple logistic regression models, and two synthetic numerical values were derived: ecological optimum (OPT) and ecological amplitude (AMP). A comparison of the ecological behaviour of species present in both regions was performed in terms of shift in optimum and/or amplitude. Results All 46 species did reveal a reaction to pH. Our main observation was the relative stability of the behaviour of most species with reference to pH conditions, which is consistent with results from some previous studies. Slight differences regarding the two synthetic parameters (OPT and AMP) were however observed between the NW and NE regions, probably due to a form of competitive release in neutral environments in the NW. Main conclusions Among the main possibilities that could explain a geographical shift in the ecological behaviour of herbaceous species, competitive effects are, we suggest, the most plausible explanation. In the light of former studies, it seems that further analyses of geographical shifts in the ecological behaviour of forest plant species over large areas are needed, such as for example over the European continent.

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDM) are widely used as indicators of different aspects of geographical ranges for many purposes, from conservation to biogeographical and evolutionary analyses. However, these techniques are susceptible to various sources of uncertainty. Data coverage, species’ ecology, and the characteristics of their geographic distributions can affect SDM results, often generating critical errors in predicted distribution maps. We assess the influence of data quality, the characteristics of species distributions, and ecological traits on SDM performance. We predict the distributions of dung beetle species in Madrid region (central Spain) using six SDM techniques and validate them on an independent dataset. We relate variations in model performance with environmental completeness, data characteristics, and species traits through a partial least squares analysis. In this analysis, body size, nesting behaviour, marginality, rarity, data prevalence, Relative Occurrence Area (ROA), range size, niche breadth, and completeness are used as predictors of six assessment metrics (sensitivity, specificity, kappa, TSS, CCR, and AUC). Marginality and data prevalence were the variables that most influenced SDM performance, followed by range size, ROA, and niche breadth: species presenting higher marginality and data prevalence, and smaller ROA and niche breadth were associated with better models. Nesting behaviour, rarity, niche completeness, and body size had minor importance for SDM performance. Our results highlight the importance of taking species’ and data characteristics into account when modelling and comparing large groups of species using SDM. This implies that estimates of species richness and composition based on stacked SDMs can show high levels of error if they are constructed for groups of species with diverse ecological traits and types of geographic distributions. We suggest that the species holding characteristics that lead to poor SDM performance should not be included when constructing composite biodiversity variables. Further effort is needed to develop SDM methodologies and protocols that account for such source of uncertainty.},

- Conclude that Marginal/"Edge" and specialist species are better predict than "middle" and generalist species, but caution with the collinearity between marginality/niche breadth and data prevalence

- Concluding remarks that could be used to justify the PhD plan on uncertainty "The increasing use of species distribution models for applied and theoretical studies in ecology, evolution, and conservation studies re-quires a careful evaluation of the effects of sources of uncertainty on model performance. The importance of data characteristics found in our study calls for increasing the quality and completeness of data used in SDMs. Well-designed surveys and new methods to deal with the uncertainty will improve the performance of SDM predictions.

	abstract = {The largest and tallest mountain range in the contiguous United States, the Southern Rocky Mountains, has warmed considerably in the past several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. Herein we examine how 47 mammal elevational ranges (27 rodent and 4 shrew species) have changed from their historical distributions (1886–1979) to their contemporary distributions (post 2005) along 2,400-m elevational gradients in the Front Range and San Juan Mountains of Colorado. Historical elevational ranges were based on more than 4,580 georeferenced museum specimen and publication records. Contemporary elevational ranges were based on 7,444 records from systematic sampling efforts and museum specimen records. We constructed Bayesian models to estimate the probability a species was present, but undetected, due to undersampling at each 50-m elevational bin for each time period and mountain range. These models leveraged individual-level detection probabilities, the number and patchiness of detections across 50-m bands of elevation, and a decaying likelihood of presence from last known detections. We compared 95\% likelihood elevational ranges between historical and contemporary time periods to detect directional change. Responses were variable as 26 mammal ranges changed upward, 6 did not change, 11 changed downward, and 4 were extirpated locally. The average range shift was 131 m upward, while exclusively montane species shifted upward more often (75\%) and displayed larger average range shifts (346 m). The best predictors of upper limit and total directional change were species with higher maximum latitude in their geographic range, montane affiliation, and the study mountain was at the southern edge of their geographic range. Thus, mammals in the Southern Rocky Mountains serve as harbingers of more changes to come, particularly for montane, cold-adapted species in the southern portion of their ranges.},

	abstract = {This study provides a novel systematic comparative analysis of the species characteristics affecting the range margin shifts in butterflies towards higher latitudes, while taking phylogenetic relatedness among species into account. We related observed changes in the northern range margins of 48 butterfly species in Finland between two time periods (1992–1996 and 2000–2004) to 11 species traits. Species with positive records in at least ten 10 km × 10 km grid squares (in the Finnish National Butterfly Recording Scheme, NAFI) in both periods were included in the study. When corrected for range size change, the 48 butterfly species had shifted their range margins northwards on average by 59.9 km between the study periods, with maximum shifts of over 300 km for three species. This rate of range shifts exceeds all previously reported records worldwide. Our findings may be explained by two factors: the study region is situated in higher latitudes than in most previous studies and it focuses on the period of most prominent warming during the last 10–15 years. Several species traits exhibited a significant univariate relationship with the range margin shift according to generalized estimation equations (GEE) taking into account the phylogenetic relatedness among species. Nonthreatened butterflies had on average expanded their ranges strongly northwards (84.5 km), whereas the distributions of threatened species were stationary (−2.1 km). Hierarchical partitioning (HP) analysis indicated that mobile butterflies living in forest edges and using woody plants as their larval hosts exhibited largest range shifts towards the north. Thus, habitat availability and dispersal capacity of butterfly species are likely to determine whether they will be successful in shifting their ranges in response to the warming climate.},

We show that recent warming constitutes an “escalator to extinction” for birds on a remote Peruvian mountain—high-elevation species have declined in both range size and abundance, and several previously common mountaintop residents have disappeared from the local community. Our findings support projections that warming will likely drive widespread extirpations and extinctions of high-elevation taxa in the tropical Andes. Such climate change-driven mountaintop extirpations may be more likely in the tropics, where temperature seems to exert a stronger control on species’ range limits than in the temperate zone. In contrast, we show that lowland bird species at our study site are expanding in range size as they shift their upper limits upslope and may thus benefit from climate change.},

Conservation managers must be able to detect, measure and accurately predict range shifts in order to mitigate impacts on biodiversity. However, important responses to climate change may go unnoticed or be dismissed if we fail to collect sufficient baseline data and apply the most sensitive analytical tests. Here we use randomizations of a contemporary data set on rainforest birds of north-eastern Australia to quantify the sensitivity of three measures for assessing range shifts along altitudinal gradients. We find that smaller range shifts are detectable by analysing change in the mean altitude of presence records rather than upper or lower range boundaries. For a moderate survey effort of 96 surveys, measurements of change in the mean altitude of 34 species have the capacity to provide strong inference for a mean altitudinal range shift as small as 40 m across the species assemblage. We also show that range shifts measured at range boundaries can be potentially misleading when differences in sampling effort between contemporary and historical data sets are not taken into account.},

	abstract = {Climate change is affecting biodiversity worldwide inducing species to either “move, adapt or die”. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for analysing range shifts, namely a catalogue of the possible patterns of change in the distribution of a species along elevational or other environmental gradients and an improved quantitative methodology to identify and objectively describe these patterns. Patterns are defined in terms of changes occurring at the leading, trailing or both edges of the distribution: (a) leading edge expansion, (b) trailing edge retraction, (c) range expansion, (d) optimum shift, (e) expansion, (f) retraction, and (g) shift. The methodology is based on the modelling of species distributions along a gradient using generalized additive models (GAMs). Separate models are calibrated for two distinct periods of assessment and response curves are compared over five reference points. Changes occurred at these points are formalized into a code that ultimately designates the corresponding change pattern. We tested the proposed methodology using data from the Swiss national common breeding bird survey. The elevational distributions of 95 bird species were modelled for the periods 1999–2002 and 2004–2007 and significant upward shifts (all patterns confounded) were identified for 35\% of the species. Over the same period, an increase in mean temperature was registered for Switzerland. In consideration of the short period covered by the case study, assessed change patterns are considered to correspond to intermediate patterns in an ongoing shifting process. However, similar patterns can be determined by habitat barriers, land use/land cover changes, competition with concurrent or invasive species or different warming rates at different elevations.},

	abstract = {Mountain areas are biodiversity hotspots and provide a multitude of ecosystem services of irreplaceable socio-economic value. In the European Alps, air temperature has increased at a rate of about 0.36°C decade−1 since 1970, leading to glacier retreat and significant snowpack reduction. Due to these rapid environmental changes, this mountainous region is undergoing marked changes in spring phenology and elevational distribution of animals, plants and fungi. Long-term monitoring in the European Alps offers an excellent natural laboratory to synthetize climate-related changes in spring phenology and elevational distribution for a large array of taxonomic groups. This review assesses the climatic changes that have occurred across the European Alps during recent decades, spring phenological changes and upslope shifts of plants, animals and fungi from evidence in published papers and previously unpublished data. Our review provides evidence that spring phenology has been shifting earlier during the past four decades and distribution ranges show an upwards trend for most of the taxonomic groups for which there are sufficient data. The first observed activity of reptiles and terrestrial insects (e.g. butterflies) in spring has shifted significantly earlier, at an average rate of −5.7 and −6.0 days decade−1, respectively. By contrast, the first observed spring activity of semi-aquatic insects (e.g. dragonflies and damselflies) and amphibians, as well as the singing activity or laying dates of resident birds, show smaller non-significant trends ranging from −1.0 to +1.3 days decade−1. Leaf-out and flowering of woody and herbaceous plants showed intermediate trends with mean values of −2.4 and −2.8 days decade−1, respectively. Regarding species distribution, plants, animals and fungi (N = 2133 species) shifted the elevation of maximum abundance (optimum elevation) upslope at a similar pace (on average between +18 and +25 m decade−1) but with substantial differences among taxa. For example, the optimum elevation shifted upward by +36.2 m decade−1 for terrestrial insects and +32.7 m decade−1 for woody plants, whereas it was estimated to range between −1.0 and +11 m decade−1 for semi-aquatic insects, ferns, birds and wood-decaying fungi. The upper range limit (leading edge) of most species also shifted upslope with a rate clearly higher for animals (from +47 to +91 m decade−1) than for plants (from +17 to +40 m decade−1), except for semi-aquatic insects (−4.7 m decade−1). Although regional land-use changes could partly explain some trends, the consistent upward shift found in almost all taxa all over the Alps is likely reflecting the strong warming and the receding of snow cover that has taken place across the European Alps over recent decades. However, with the possible exception of terrestrial insects, the upward shift of organisms seems currently too slow to track the pace of isotherm shifts induced by climate warming, estimated at about +62 to +71 m decade−1 since 1970. In the light of these results, species interactions are likely to change over multiple trophic levels through phenological and spatial mismatches. This nascent research field deserves greater attention to allow us to anticipate structural and functional changes better at the ecosystem level.},

	abstract = {Ongoing global climate change is driving widespread shifts in species distributions. Trends show frequent upwards shifts of treelines, but information on changes in montane forest below the treeline and in the tropics and subtropics is limited, despite the importance of these areas for biodiversity and ecosystem function. Patterns of species shifts in tropical and subtropical regions are likely to be more complex and individualistic than global averages suggest due to high species diversity and strong influence of competition, alongside direct climatic limitations on distributions. To address the question of how subtropical montane tree species are likely to move as climate changes, we used an extensive national forest inventory to estimate distribution shifts of 75 tree species in Taiwan by comparing the optimum elevation and range edges of adults and juveniles within species. Overall there was a significant difference in optimum elevation of adults and juveniles. Life stage mismatches suggested upward shifts in 35\% of species but downward shifts of over half (56\%), while 8\% appeared stable. Upward elevation shifts were disproportionately common in high elevation species, whilst mid to low elevation species suggested greater variation in shift direction. Whilst previous research on mountain forest range shifts has been dominated by work addressing changes in treeline position, we show that although high elevation species shift up, below the treeline species may shift individualistically, heralding widespread changes in forest communities over coming decades. The wide variation of responses indicated is likely driven by individual species responses to interacting environmental factors such as competition, topography and anthropogenic influences across the broad range of forest types investigated. As global environmental changes continue, more detailed understanding of tree range shifts across a wide spectrum of forests will allow us to prepare for the implications of such changes for biodiversity, ecosystem function and dependent human populations.},

	abstract = {The study aimed to examine the effects of different numbers of presences and frequencies (proportions) of occurrences of species in a plot data set of forest vegetation on the species response curves and their niche attributes, based on Huisman-Olff-Fresco models (HOF). We modeled responses of 72 to 105 herbaceous forest species along a pH gradient under 14 different random sampling scenarios by varying the number of presences and absences used for model fitting. Mean niche attributes were calculated from 100 repetitive runs for each scenario and species. Re-prediction success of HOF models among the repetitive runs was highest when the total number of plots was high and the frequency of occurrences was low. With low plot numbers and high frequencies, less complicated model types (no response or monotonically increasing/decreasing responses) predominate. Measures of species niche boundaries (limits \& borders) and niche width were strongly influenced by changes in sampling characteristics. With an increasing number of presences and an increasing frequency, limits and borders shifted to more extreme values, leading to wider niches. In contrast, species optima showed almost no change between the scenarios. Thus, the detected ecological response of a species often depends on the size of the data set and the relation between presences and absences of a species. In general, high data quantities are required for reliable response curve modeling with HOF models, which prevents the assessment of the responses of many rare species. To avoid undesired bias by differing sampling characteristics when comparing niches between different species or between data sets, the data basis used for model fitting should be adjusted according to the niche attribute in question, for example by keeping the frequency of the species constant.},

Shows that numbers of presences and frequencies of occurrences of species affect the species response curves and their niche attributes based on Huisman-Olff-Fresco models (HOF).Shows that flexible models (such as HOF models) can attribute different shapes of species response curves because of the structure of the data (nb of presences and frequencies) and not because of the ecological response. Maybe models that follow ecological theories should be preferred to flexible models.

Even so, the relative contribution of species detectability to the variation in measured range shift rates among species is poorly understood. How can true range shifts be discerned from sampling artefacts? Location Australia. Methods We simulate range shifts for species which differ in their abundance for comparison to patterns derived from empirical range shift data from two regional-scale (100s km) empirical studies. We demonstrate the use of spatial occupancy data in a distance-to-edge (DTE) model to assess changes in geographical range edges of fish species within a temperate reef fish community. Results Simulations identified how sampling design can produce relatively larger error in range shift estimates in less abundant species, patterns that correspond with those observed in real data. Application of the DTE model allowed us to estimate the location of the true range edge with high accuracy in common species. In addition, upper confidence bounds for range edge estimates identified species with range edges that have likely shifted in location. Conclusions Simulation and modelling approaches used to quantify the level of confidence that can be placed in observed range shifts are particularly valuable for studies of marine species, where observations are typically few and patchy. Given the observed variability in range shift estimates, the inclusion of confidence bounds on estimates of geographical range edges will advance our capacity to disentangle true distributional change from artefacts of sampling design.},

	abstract = {Climate change has been linked to well-documented changes in physiology, phenology, species distributions, and in some cases, extinction. Projections of future change point to dramatic shifts in the states of many ecosystems. Accommodating these shifts to effectively conserve biodiversity in the context of uncertain climate regimes represents one of the most difficult challenges faced by conservation planners. A number of adaptation strategies have been proposed for managing species and ecosystems in a changing climate. However, there has been little guidance available on integrating climate change adaptation strategies into contemporary conservation planning frameworks. The paper reviews the different approaches being used to integrate climate change adaptation into conservation planning, broadly categorizing strategies as continuing and extending on “best practice” principles and those that integrate species vulnerability assessments into conservation planning. We describe the characteristics of a good adaptation strategy emphasizing the importance of incorporating clear principles of flexibility and efficiency, accounting for uncertainty, integrating human response to climate change and understanding trade-offs.

Editor’s notes
Biodiversity provides basic needs for livelihoods and development of human beings. China, as one of countries with richest biodiversity in the world, contains 17 globally significant biodiversity hotspots. It was observed that climate change has impacted the biodiversity more or less from physiological, phonological and species level, to ecosystem level, and in some cases extinction of species. With the increasing climate change, the biodiversity subject to be more significantly impacted and human intervention is expected to amplify the impacts. Climate change is believed to be one of key threats of the biodiversity conservation. What kinds of cost-effective strategies and measures may be taken to allow biodiversity to adapt climate change impacts is a great challenge in China. This special issue invited three authors to share actions and experiences on the adaptation of biodiversity to climate change, including a case study, a review of adaptation planning and an introduction of national strategy and research developments. The editors hope these articles can provide useful information for the biodiversity conservation under climate change in China.},

We then discuss reasons for the poor performance of traits for describing interspecific variation in range shifts from two perspectives: (a) factors associated with species’ traits that degrade range-shift signals stemming from the measures used for species’ traits, traits that are typically not analyzed, and the influence of phylogeny on range-shift potential and (b) issues in quantifying range shifts and relating them to species’ traits due to imperfect detection of species, differences in the responses of altitudinal and latitudinal ranges, and emphasis on testing linear relationships between traits and range shifts instead of nonlinear responses. Improving trait-based approaches requires a recognition that traits within individuals interact in unexpected ways and that different combinations of traits may be functionally equivalent. }

This work proposes using shape-constrained generalized additive models (SC-GAMs) to build species distribution models under the ecological niche theory framework, imposing concavity constraints in the linear predictor scale. Based on a simulation study and a real data application, we compared performance with respect to other regression models without shape-constraints (such as standard GLMs and GAMs with varying degrees of freedom) and also to models based on so-called “Plateau” climate-envelopes. The imposition of concavity for response curves resulted in a good balance between the goodness of fit (GOF) and agreement with ecological niche theory.

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to explain and predict species ranges and environmental niches. They are most commonly constructed by inferring species' occurrence–environment relationships using statistical and machine-learning methods. The variety of methods that can be used to construct SDMs (e.g. generalized linear/additive models, tree-based models, maximum entropy, etc.), and the variety of ways that such models can be implemented, permits substantial flexibility in SDM complexity. Building models with an appropriate amount of complexity for the study objectives is critical for robust inference. We characterize complexity as the shape of the inferred occurrence–environment relationships and the number of parameters used to describe them, and search for insights into whether additional complexity is informative or superfluous. By building ‘under fit’ models, having insufficient flexibility to describe observed occurrence–environment relationships, we risk misunderstanding the factors shaping species distributions. By building ‘over fit’ models, with excessive flexibility, we risk inadvertently ascribing pattern to noise or building opaque models. However, model selection can be challenging, especially when comparing models constructed under different modeling approaches. Here we argue for a more pragmatic approach: researchers should constrain the complexity of their models based on study objective, attributes of the data, and an understanding of how these interact with the underlying biological processes. We discuss guidelines for balancing under fitting with over fitting and consequently how complexity affects decisions made during model building. Although some generalities are possible, our discussion reflects differences in opinions that favor simpler versus more complex models. We conclude that combining insights from both simple and complex SDM building approaches best advances our knowledge of current and future species ranges.},

	abstract = {Although biogeographic patterns are the product of complex ecological processes, the increasing complexity of correlative species distribution models (SDMs) is not always motivated by ecological theory, but by model fit. The validity of model projections, such as shifts in a species’ climatic niche, becomes questionable particularly during extrapolations, such as for future no-analog climate conditions. To examine the effects of model complexity on SDM predictive performance, we fit statistical models of varying complexity to simulated species occurrence data arising from data-generating processes that assume differing degrees of distributional symmetry in environmental space, interaction effects, and coverage in climate space. Mismatches between data-generating processes and statistical models (i.e., different functional forms) led to poor predictive performance when extrapolating to new climate-space and greater variation in extrapolated predictions for overly complex models. In contrast, performance issues were not apparent when using independent evaluation data from the training region. These results draw into question the use of highly flexible models for prediction without ecological justification.},

	shorttitle = {Statistical {Rethinking}},
	abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers’ knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today’s model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.

The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.

By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling. 
Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author’s website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00190-4},
	abstract = {The shape of species’ responses along ecological gradients has important implications for both continuum theory and community analysis. Most current theories and analytical models in community ecology assume that responses are unimodal and symmetric. However, interactions between species and extreme environmental stress may cause skewed or non-unimodal responses. To date, statistical tools for evaluating response shapes have been either inappropriate, inefficient or biased. Using a data set on vascular plant distributions along an elevation gradient, we show that Huisman–Olff–Fresco (HOF) models are an effective method for this purpose, allowing models of various forms (skewed, symmetric, plateau, monotonic) to be tested for adequacy. HOF modeling was compared with alternative methods for response fitting, including Gaussian responses as Generalized linear model (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Beta Functions with fixed or estimated endpoints. In our data set, skewed and plateau responses are less common than symmetric ones. Less than half of the species have skewed or plateau responses that can not be adequately modeled by Gaussian models. We show that Beta function models with fixed endpoints are biased, confounding skewness and the location of the mode and should not be used to test response shapes. Beta models with estimated endpoints are fairly consistent with other models. GAM's cannot provide clear tests of skewness or kurtosis of response curves, though we show that GAM's, in general, confirmed the shapes chosen by HOF modeling. We provide free software for fitting HOF models and encourage further applications to community data collected along different types of ecological gradients.},

	abstract = {To make progress scientists need to know what other researchers have found and how they found it. However, transparency is often insufficient across much of ecology and evolution. Researchers often fail to report results and methods in detail sufficient to permit interpretation and meta-analysis, and many results go entirely unreported. Further, these unreported results are often a biased subset. Thus the conclusions we can draw from the published literature are themselves often biased and sometimes might be entirely incorrect. Fortunately there is a movement across empirical disciplines, and now within ecology and evolution, to shape editorial policies to better promote transparency. This can be done by either requiring more disclosure by scientists or by developing incentives to encourage disclosure.},

	abstract = {Community ecologists and conservation biologists often work with data that are too sparse for achieving reliable inference with species-specific approaches. Here we explore the idea of combining species-specific models into a single hierarchical model. The community component of the model seeks for shared patterns in how the species respond to environmental covariates. We illustrate the modeling framework in the context of logistic regression and presence–absence data, but a similar hierarchical structure could also be used in many other types of applications. We first use simulated data to illustrate that the community component can improve parameterization of species-specific models especially for rare species, for which the data would be too sparse to be informative alone. We then apply the community model to real data on 500 diatom species to show that it has much greater predictive power than a collection of independent species-specific models. We use the modeling approach to show that roughly one-third of distance decay in community similarity can be explained by two variables characterizing water quality, rare species typically preferring nutrient-poor waters with high pH, and common species showing a more general pattern of resource use.},
